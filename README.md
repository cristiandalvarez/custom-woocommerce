Welcome to the repository of additional functions (tricks) for WooCommerce. The purpose is to be able to adjust this powerful plugin to our needs using only what we require on each site. Also, you can follow me as [@cristiandalvarez](https://instagram.com/cristiandalvarez) on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/cristiandalvarez) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cristiandalvrez) to get the latest updates on repository updates or additional WordPress or entrepreneurship information.

Remember that in order to use these filters and functions you must have [WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/) installed.

## Requirements
* Have [WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/) installed.
* Have an external plugin to add [snippets](https://wordpress.org/plugins/code-snippets/) or your Child Theme.

## Important
* All features have been tested up to WooCommerce 4.0.1

## Questions?
The functions can be used separately. Each is defined so as not to depend on the others. These functions will prevent the excessive use of plugins within a WordPress installation to fulfill the essential aspects mentioned in them.

* We recommend testing in a development environment that does not affect a production area. I do not assume responsibilities for damages.
